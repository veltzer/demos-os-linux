- do automatic test that checks that every exercise has a solution.
	exercise.md -> solution.cc in the same folder.

- add example for using inline for optimization.
	Compare the runtime of doing a million method calls when the method is inlined vs not inlined.
	This will be a method on an object.

- do a few examples of a singleton in C++:
	with regular race
	with double check (reordeing race).
	with no race
	with std::call_once solution
	wit Scott Mayer solution
